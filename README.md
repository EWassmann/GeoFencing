# GeoFencing
this code uses the sparkfun RTK gps, when ran it will initally instuct you to use wasd (hitting s once stops the robnot and s twice puts it in reverse, you must hit enter after all wasd commands) to move the robot, and q to quit.
in this inital part you are creating the geofence, after you drive in the shape you want the fence to be and hit q it automatically 
creates the fence. Now you can drive as before but if you exit the fence you will lose control of the robot and it will back itself
back into the fence before handing back control to you. press q to exit like before. 
the arduino code that controlls the motor controller and servos is included.
the code titled heading included is not finished and will not work properly
